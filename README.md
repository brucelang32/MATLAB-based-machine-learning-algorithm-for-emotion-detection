# MATLAB-based-machine-learning-algorithm-for-emotion-detection
My thesis: applied a MATLAB-based ML algorithm to test the effect of spatial frequency on detection advantage of human emotional faces, involving data processing by Python and data modeling.

1) All details are written in my paper, inlcuding the purpose and methond of the whoile project.

2) We create a Protosc app to implement the emotion detection algorithm, you can download here to see how to use it by tutorial.pdf.

3) A Python script of date-preprocessing are included here as well.
